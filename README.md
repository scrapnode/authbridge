# @scrapnode/authbridge

> Spend less time on identity verification and more on building with AuthBridge's quick start options

## Goals

- Code boilerplate to save project authenitcation init time
- Predefine template so you can easily custom your confirmation email template
- Expose REST APIs so developers have another option to integrate with their system (forward auth is a good use case)

## Notes:

- [Cognito Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html)
